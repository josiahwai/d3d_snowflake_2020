% 
%   PURPOSE: Design ITER-Similiar-Shape for generic tokamak
%            Demonstrates gsdesign capabilities by designing
%            the ITER shape for ITER and 9 additional tokamaks
%            No coil connections are specified
%            No coil current limits specified but gsdesign has
%            defaults for some tokamaks
% 
%   INPUTS:  none
% 
%   OUTPUTS: eq, equilibrium for specified tokamak
