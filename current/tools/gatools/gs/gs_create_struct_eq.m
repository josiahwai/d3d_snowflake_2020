%   USAGE:   gs_create_struct_eq
% 
%   PURPOSE:  Create a structure eq with an equilibrium description of same Toksys format
%             as is returned by read_mds_eqdsk.m and with additional fields that are used
%             by write_afile.m & write_gfile.m
% 
%   INPUTS:   Several equilibrium quantities produced by codes gs_*.m
% 
%   OUTPUTS:  eq, structure with equilibrium on Toksys format
