%   USAGE:   e = gscircle(c)
% 
%   PURPOSE: Create circular equilibrium
% 
%   INPUTS: c, configuration (the output from gsconfig)
% 
%   OUTPUTS: e, circular equilibrium
% 
%   This is an approximate 1D Grad-Shafranov solution
%   The axis is in the center, there is no Shafranov shift in the model
%   The boundary is a perfect circle, shaping coils are not in the model
